FURNITURED APP

 Furnitured App is a React application built with Vite, including various libraries and tools.
 
 I curretly develop this mobile-first furniture webshop, an easy-to-follow-through application for the best user experience.
 The backend, UX/UI, and the entire design process is my only work, even though i studied mainly frontend skills. 
 This is the first application i started all by myself from the very beginning to the point i am at right now. 
 Which means, desktop views, some filters, toasts and post methods are painfully missing, and waiting for me to carry on.
 However a lot is done, the main effort was the basket lately which involved global variables. The flow is already quite apparent and clear, the menu items all navigate to their pages.
 
 The main idea was to create a new feature which helps users to match selected furnitures in the show room, before they place items in the basket to encourage future purchase and satisfaction,
 and to be fair, make it a little playful for the audience.
 Also to simplify design not to draw user's attention to the surroundings, but focus on the furniture itself. Something important to me to have on board, so i would set: dark mode. Gives it even more contrast.
 The last to mention among many others to keep user's engagement in the application is the newsletter, which sends information via email only in the selected subjects that meet the user's interest.
